Explanations around how to forward connections in order to allow training across machines, i.e., one machine runs the ANN, and it uses for training the data from several CFD server machines.

See ```learning_to_tunnel``` for some simple training / explanation about forwarding.

See ```training_across_network``` for example specific to this code.
